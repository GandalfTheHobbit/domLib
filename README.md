# domLib
A little javascript library designed for manipulating html DOM

# Installation
Installing this is as easy as dragging and dropping the js file in the src folder (There will be a minified version soon) and including it in the html head element.

# Usage
With this library, you access it by using commands that start with "d". An example is d.setSize(). You then include the data inside the brackets. You can learn more in the documentation file.
